# Checkbox Toggle

The main purpose of this plugin is to toggle a task checkboxes on markdown files.

## Motivation

I use the [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim) a lot, making checklists for work, and the procedures I made with my colleagues. On _onsidian.nvim_ you can toggle the checkbox with `<leader>ch`, but you can't use it if you visually select a lot of lines.

TODO: Finish motivation section and add links
